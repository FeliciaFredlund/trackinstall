# Track Installs

A CLI to track manually installed programs/apps and their dependencies, especially useful when mainly using package managers but when it isn't available for a program/app (or you need a later version than the package manager repo has).

## Usage

## About this project

This project was started and an intial MVP (I hope!) was completed during a [boot.dev](https://boot.dev) hackathon in July 2025. I created it so I could track manual installations on my own machines to ensure that my OS doesn't slowly bloat.

## Change log

TO BE ADDED when MVP is done
